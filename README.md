# Portfolio Showcase

Welcome to my portfolio showcase! This repository contains a dataset named **trashnet** and an IPython Notebook file demonstrating how I handle the following processes:

1. Image Preprocessing
2. Model Architecture
3. Hyperparameter Settings
4. Model Performance Evaluation
5. Training Accuracy & Loss Visualization

# Project Overview

This is a personal project where I used the **trashnet** dataset provided by Hugging Face to build a CNN image classification model and ultimately visualize the model's performance.

**Data Source:**
[TrashNet Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/garythung/trashnet/tree/main)

## Getting Started

To get started, simply navigate the IPython Notebook. The markdown within should provide a clear view of what I did during the process, and it should run successfully after changing the directory to your custom device.
